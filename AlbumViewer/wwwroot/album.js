        "Description": "Motörhead are the founding fathers of speed and thrash metal. Without this band, there would be no Slayer or Sepultura, so you've at least got to give Lemmy and Co. props for being so influential. And \"Aces of Spades\" is an essential, legendary speed metal classic. It's full of fast, meaty riffs, great solos, toe-tapping drums, and catchy, gruff vocals. Almost every song on here (especially the title track, \"Love Me Like a Reptile,\" and \"We Are The Road Crew\") is very catchy. And the album opening title track, which has a speedy, groove-y main riff, is world renowned. Other highlights include the wah-wah solo and shout-along refrain on \"Fire, Fire,\" \"Jailbait,\" \"Dance\" (which has a pair of tasty guitar solos), the X-rated \"The Chase Is Better Than The Catch,\" and the famous, rhythmic, nearly dance-able \"Please Don't Touch.\" All in all, if you're looking for great, groove-y, contagious and exciting speed metal, Motorhead \"aces\" it.",

        "Description": "Act III  is the third studio album by the thrash metal band Death Angel, released in 1990 on Geffen Records. Regarded by many critics and fans as the band's finest effort, the album was produced by famed metal producer Max Norman (Ozzy Osbourne, Megadeth, Loudness), and marked the first (and only) major label release by Death Angel. The album spawned the singles \"Seemingly Endless Time\" and \"A Room with a View\", with both songs receiving music videos and airplay on MTV's Headbangers Ball. Songs like \"Discontinued\" incorporate elements of funk.\n\n@icon-warning On tour in support of Act III in 1991, the band suffered a serious tour **bus crash** in which drummer Andy Galeon was critically injured. During his yearlong recovery, singer Mark Osegueda left the band, effectively ending Death Angel. In 2001, the band reunited for Testament singer Chuck Billy's Thrash of the Titans benefit concert (minus Gus Pepa) and went on to release The Art of Dying in 2004, followed by three more albums.",

Death Angel has released seven studio albums, two demo tapes, one box set and two live albums.\r\n\r\nTwo independent releases, The Ultra-Violence (1987) and Frolic Through the Park (1988), attracted the attention of Geffen Records, which signed the quintet in 1989 and released their next album, Act III, one year later. While Death Angel was touring in support of Act III, drummer Andy Galeon was injured in a tour bus accident and needed more than a year to fully recover. This resulted in the band's break up in 1991. However, Death Angel reformed in 2001 (without original guitarist Gus Pepa) at the Thrash of the Titans benefit concert for Testament singer Chuck Billy. The band continues to record and perform today.",
